# JavaScript challenge Instructions
The Color Palette is a simple application to create a range of custom-named colors, each with a star rating. You can add colors and delete them.

It utilizes `<input type="color">`, the HTML5 visual color picker interface. See the [MDN documentation for the web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color).

## Running the application locally
```
npm install
npm start
```

Use `npm test` to run tests.

## Fixing the current system

You can do this exercise in one of two flavors: Ember Classic or React. Decide which you want to work with. Depending on your choice, you'll use one of two different directories:

- Ember Classic: `ember-colorpalette-classic`
- React: `colorpalette-react`


1. Make sure you have checked out the `master` branch and that there are no outstanding changes. If you are interviewing for the _senior_ javascript role, you should check out the `advanced-troubleshooting` branch.
1. Review `demo.mov` in the proper subdirectory to see how the system is supposed to behave.
1. Install dependencies and start the development server and see how the system _currently_ behaves.
1. Run the automated tests. Do they pass?
1. There are many things wrong with the system as compared to the demo. Please fix them.

> **Note:** there is likely more work to do here than you have time for and you have multiple independent things wrong and can start wherever you like. The interviewer will likely stop you before you're finished in order to ask you other questions.

## Writing new features
Pick a new feature to the system by picking a challenge you feel comfortable getting done in the time you have left. Below youâ€™ll find some options. Ensure you write a test for whatever feature you add. For extra credit, write the test first.

### Feature choices

1. Make the form validate input: must have a name and a non-default color. Disable the submit button.
1. Make it so the "reset" button on the form does not have the same styling as the submit button.
1. Refactor the voting system. What would you do to make this look more beautiful and to make the code cleaner?
1. Add a mirage infrastructure and use Ember Data instead of an array.
